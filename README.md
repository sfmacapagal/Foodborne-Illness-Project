# Foodborne-Illness-Project

## Summary of project

This repository houses the analysis completed for the STAT 626 - Time Series group project. Our group took two months to analyze the behavior of foodborne illnesses and diseases from 1998 to 2015. We collaborated in three rounds:

1. basic EDA
2. basic ARMA modeling
3. constructing, selecting, forecasting and validating more complex models

After each round, we collaborated on reporting and presenting, culminating in a final 10-page report and 20-minute presentation, followed by Q&A.

## Summary of findings

Foodborne illnesses can be cyclic in nature, so seasonal ARIMA models tend to be the best fitting for our data, while more complex models may overfit. Modeling individual diseases tends to produces better fit and forecasts than does modeling overall trends; however, consumer behavior and regulatory schemes should be used to contextualize the various patterns across time.
