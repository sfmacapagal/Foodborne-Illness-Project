## Salmonella analysis

```{r}
df_outbreaks_salmonella <- csv_outbreaks %>%
  mutate(date = glue::glue("{year}-{month}"), # concatenates year-month
         date = ym(date), # changes to date format
         time = time_length(interval(min(date), date),
                            unit = "month")) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(species, "Salmonella")) %>%
  group_by(time, year, month, date) %>%
  summarize(total_illnesses = sum(illnesses, na.rm = TRUE),
         total_hospitalizations = sum(hospitalizations, na.rm = TRUE),
         total_fatalities = sum(fatalities, na.rm = TRUE),
         log_illnesses = log(total_illnesses),
         log_hospitalizations = log(total_hospitalizations),
         log_fatalities = log(total_fatalities)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(diff_log_illnesses = c(NA, diff(log_illnesses)),
         diff_log_hospitalizations = c(NA, diff(log_hospitalizations)),
         diff_log_fatalities = c(NA, diff(log_fatalities))) %>%
  arrange(time)
```

```{r}
# gg time series of log salmonella
df_outbreaks_salmonella %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = date,
                y = log_illnesses)) +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "log(Illnesses) per month",
       title = "Salmonella illnesses over time",
       subtitle = "January 1998 - December 2015") +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%b",
               breaks = function(x) seq.Date(from = min(x),
                                             to = max(x),
                                             by = "2 years"),

## gg acf plot
autoplot(acf(df_outbreaks_salmonella$log_illnesses, plot = FALSE)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Lag",
       y = "ACF")

## gg pacf plot
autoplot(pacf(df_outbreaks_salmonella$log_illnesses, plot = FALSE)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Lag",
       y = "PACF")


## base R plots
tsplot(df_outbreaks_salmonella$diff_log_illnesses)
acf2(df_outbreaks_salmonella$log_illnesses)
```

```{r}
sarima(df_outbreaks_salmonella$log_illnesses, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 12)

ggfortify::ggtsdiag(forecast::auto.arima(df_outbreaks_salmonella$log_illnesses, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 12))
```

```{r}
ccf2(df_outbreaks_salmonella$log_illnesses,
     df_outbreaks_salmonella$log_hospitalizations)
```

Let's try to forecast the next few periods:

```{r}
sarima.for(df_outbreaks_salmonella$log_illnesses, n.ahead = 12,
           1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 12)
```

Our initial goal was to compare our forecasts against the CDC data for the years after 2015, but it turns out they only released the summaries and not the raw data yet.
	
## Escherichia coli analysis

         time = time_length(interval(min(date), date),
                            unit = "month")) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(species, "Escherichia coli")) %>%
  group_by(time, year, month, date) %>%
  summarize(total_illnesses = sum(illnesses, na.rm = TRUE),
         total_hospitalizations = sum(hospitalizations, na.rm = TRUE),
         total_fatalities = sum(fatalities, na.rm = TRUE),
         log_illnesses = log(total_illnesses),

         diff_log_illnesses = c(NA, diff(log_illnesses)),
         diff_log_hospitalizations = c(NA, diff(log_hospitalizations)),
         diff_log_fatalities = c(NA, diff(log_fatalities))) %>%
  arrange(time)
```


```{r}

acf2(df_outbreaks_ecoli$log_illnesses)
```

```{r}
ccf2(df_outbreaks_ecoli$log_illnesses, df_outbreaks_ecoli$log_hospitalizations)

## Norovirus analysis

```{r}

         date = ym(date), # changes to date format
         time = time_length(interval(min(date), date),
                            unit = "month")) %>%
